## 🎯 What this episode covers

Before installing any tool, you need a **threat model** — a personal map of what you're protecting, from whom, and how much effort is worth it. This episode is the blueprint for everything that follows in the series.

---

## ✅ Privacy Steps

### Step 1 — Define your assets

Write down what you actually want to protect. Be specific.

**Examples:**
- Real identity / legal name
- Physical location (home, school, work)
- Browsing history
- Communication content (DMs, emails)
- Financial data
- Social graph (who you talk to)

**Action:** Make a list. You'll reference this in every future episode.

### Step 2 — Identify your adversary

Pick your adversary tier honestly. Most people are T1–T3.

| Tier | Adversary | Capability |
|------|-----------|------------|
| T1 | Advertisers & data brokers | Behavioral tracking, fingerprinting, profile selling |
| T2 | Big Tech (Google, Meta) | Cross-device linking, full telemetry, app-level data |
| T3 | ISP | DNS queries, unencrypted traffic, throttling |
| T4 | Law enforcement (domestic) | Legal data requests, device seizure, warrants |
| T5 | Nation-state / intelligence | Traffic analysis, zero-days, metadata correlation |

> **For most users:** T1–T3 is your real threat. Designing for T5 when you're facing T1 wastes effort and destroys usability.

---

### Step 3 — Assess your risk

For each asset + adversary pair, score the risk:
```
Risk = Likelihood × Impact

Likelihood: How probable is it that this adversary targets this asset?
Impact:     How bad is it if they succeed?
```

**Quick scale:**
- `Low` — unlikely to be targeted, low consequence if it happens
- `Medium` — possible, moderate consequence
- `High` — likely, serious consequence
- `Critical` — near-certain, catastrophic consequence

---

### Step 4 — Set your tradeoff threshold

Privacy costs convenience. Decide your threshold upfront:

| Mode | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| `Comfort first` | Minor tweaks only — still use Google, WhatsApp, etc. |
| `Balanced` | Switch to better defaults, keep some big-tech tools |
| `Privacy first` | Significant behaviour change, drop convenience for protection |
| `Paranoid` | Full OPSEC — compartmentalisation, Tor, Tails, alias identity |

> Most people reading this should aim for **Balanced**.

---

### Step 5 — Fill your threat model template
```
MY ASSETS:        [ list them ]
MY ADVERSARY:     [ T1 / T2 / T3 / T4 / T5 ]
MY RISK LEVEL:    [ low / medium / high / critical ]
MY TRADEOFF:      [ comfort / balanced / privacy first / paranoid ]
MY FIRST ACTION:  [ one concrete step from EP.02 onwards ]
```

Save this. Every future episode maps back to it.

## 🛠️ Tools mentioned

None — this episode is framework only. Tools start from EP.02.

---

## ✅ Verification

You've done it right if:

- [ ] You can name your top 3 assets without hesitation
- [ ] You can state your adversary tier confidently
- [ ] You have a written threat model filled out
- [ ] You know whether you're Balanced or Privacy First

## ⚠️ Common mistakes

- ❌ Skipping this and jumping straight to VPN shopping
- ❌ Claiming T5 adversary when you have zero operational risk
- ❌ Treating privacy as binary
- ❌ "I have nothing to hide" — privacy is about power, not secrets
- ❌ Protecting content but ignoring metadata
